# Task 3: Responsive Layout Using Flexbox

## Description
This project focuses on creating a mobile-friendly, responsive web layout using CSS Flexbox. The goal was to align navigation bars, content cards, and list items dynamically based on screen size.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Flex Containers**: Applied `display: flex` to parent elements to enable flexible layouts.
- **Alignment & Positioning**: Used `justify-content` and `align-items` for precise control over element positioning.
- **Responsiveness**: Implemented `flex-wrap` to allow elements to move to the next line on smaller screens.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Created a horizontal navigation bar that adjusts automatically.

## Tools Used
- Primary: VS Code and Browser DevTools.
- Testing: Device simulation in the browser to ensure responsiveness.
